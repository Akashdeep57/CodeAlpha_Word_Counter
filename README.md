# Code Explanation
Swing Components: The application uses JFrame for the main window, JTextArea for text input, JButton for the word count action, and JLabel for displaying the result.
Word Counting Logic: The word count is performed by splitting the text based on whitespace using the split("\\s+") method, which counts words separated by spaces.

private static int countWords(String text) {
    if (text == null || text.trim().isEmpty()) {
        return 0;
    }
    String[] words = text.trim().split("\\s+");
    return words.length;
}
# Future Improvements
Character Count: Add functionality to count characters in addition to words.
Text File Support: Allow users to load text from a file and count words from the file.
Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode theme for the application.
# Common Issues/Troubleshooting
Java Version Compatibility: Ensure that you are using JDK 8 or higher. If you encounter issues with running the application, check your Java version with java -version.
IDE Configuration: If you have trouble running the project in STS, ensure that the project is correctly imported and the classpath is set.
